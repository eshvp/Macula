# Senior Research Macula

This is my senior research titled "Macula". The "Macula" is a small, oval-shaped area in the center of the retina at the back of the eye. It is responsible for sharp, central vision and fine detail. 
A fitting name for this project and it's intended end goal. Macula is a facial recognition software meant to provide high quality and high precision facial recognition capabilites to already 
implemented security infrastructure. In simple terms it can be overlayed without any additional cost to the client. It's main purpose is to mitigate unauthorized users from accessing restricted 
areas, with it's research focusing on public spaces, like hospitals and schools. This is performed by an organization scanning each employees face into their database, then assinging them security 
access to certain areas. This way, those who do not have the appropriate security clearance, won't be able to enter that restricted zone, mitigating access to unauthorized users.
