pip install faiss-cpu  # or faiss-gpu for GPU acceleration

For now use cpu
For larger data sets, use GPU

Regarding recognition.py
- Trying to speed up the loading of users for recogntion function. Seems like paralleling will help (duh). Also GPU acceleration (duh).
- Apparently 'You're running the detector on every image rather than caching the face location.' - Gotta fix that. 
- Database rebuilding:  You're completely rebuilding the FAISS index and database each time.
